# Bloody Coven

They fled. Their gardens were burnt, their familiars slaughtered and their stashes wiped.

Their art was decimated. In the hidden grove, using last ingredients they had, they summoned a demon.

They pledged for the help. For the help against magic-nullifying alchemy of the cowards proclaiming themselves hunters.
And for the revenge.

The demon was appeased by the despair, the anguish and the wraith of the summoners. Or, maybe, he was just
entertained...

Some say, the demon summoned was none else than Prince Belial themselves... and the magic he taught... was worse than
one could imagine in the wildest nightmares.

# TODO

> basically, replacing gardening from Witchery with butchering both enemies and innocents and paying for rituals with your max hp

- blood item, maybe called Coagulated Blood or Blood Clot
- blood runes, which are placed by using blood item (or compatible items from other mods?)
- heart rune, placed with blood item with 4 normal runes at its sides placed before it
- butcher enchantment for swords, drops mod items from killed entities (blood clot, beast fangs, witch eye, etc...)
  and is incompatible with looting
- ritual items, apart from blood clot: represent the strength of particular entity with a somewhat related body part (e.g. wolves – strength, bite – fangs; witches, illusioners, evokers – knowledge, perception - eyes) or just grotesque (villager meat)
- ritual system:
  * rituals performed by dropping items atop of a heart rune, then activating the rune and waiting for items to be consumed
  * heart rune has to be surrounded by 4 normal runes, some rituals might use additional runes to shape the magic
  * rituals are paid with the health of caster or casters, most advanced rituals reduce health permanently (i.e. creating blood golems/homunculi)
